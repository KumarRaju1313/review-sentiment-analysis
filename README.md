## 📘 Project Overview

This project analyzes user-written Amazon reviews using NLP and machine learning.  
It involves text cleaning, feature extraction using **TF-IDF**, and model building for **rating prediction (1–5)**.

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset consists of Amazon product reviews, with each entry containing:

- `ProductId`: Product's unique ID  
- `UserId`: Reviewer’s ID  
- `ProfileName`: Reviewer’s name  
- `HelpfulnessNumerator/Denominator`: Helpfulness vote stats  
- `Score`: Rating (1 to 5)  
- `Time`: Review timestamp  
- `ReviewSummary`: Short summary  
- `ReviewText`: Full review content  

📦 Sample file provided:
- `txt_reviews.zip`: Sample raw review files

---

## 🔑 Key Steps

### 🔸 1. Data Extraction
- Extract `.txt` reviews from ZIP
- Load into a Pandas DataFrame

### 🔸 2. Preprocessing
- Calculate helpfulness ratio
- Convert Unix timestamp to datetime
- Clean & tokenize reviews
- Remove stopwords and lemmatize text

### 🔸 3. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- Score distribution plots  
- Helpfulness rating visualizations

### 🔸 4. Text Vectorization
- Apply **TF-IDF** to convert text into numerical vectors

### 🔸 5. Model Training
Trained and evaluated multiple classifiers:

- Logistic Regression  
- Multinomial Naive Bayes  
- Gradient Boosting  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Random Forest

## 📊 Results

| Model                   | Accuracy   |
|--------------------------|------------|
| Logistic Regression      | **71.59%** ✅ |
| SVM                      | 71.53%     |
| Random Forest            | 70.23%     |
| Gradient Boosting        | 67.55%     |
| Multinomial Naive Bayes  | 65.74%     |

✅ **Logistic Regression** performed best among the models.

## 💡 Insights

- Text data preprocessing significantly impacts model performance.
- **TF-IDF** was effective for this task over raw tokens.
- Logistic Regression and SVM gave close accuracy, but Logistic Regression had a slight edge.
- Gradient Boosting underperformed possibly due to high feature dimensionality.
